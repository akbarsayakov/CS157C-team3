Chopped Salad,"Place a rack in the middle of oven and preheat to 350°F. Cut squash into quarters and scoop out seeds. Place skin side down on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Whisk lemon juice, honey, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl and rub all over cut sides of squash; season with salt and pepper. Roast until very tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Let cool.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Arrange brussels sprouts cut side down in skillet and cook, undisturbed, until well browned, about 4 minutes. Toss and continue to cook, tossing occasionally and reducing heat as needed, until browned all over, about 5 minutes longer. Reduce heat to medium; add butter, thyme, rosemary, and garlic. Tip skillet toward you so butter pools on one side and cook, spooning butter over brussels sprouts, until butter smells nutty, about 4 minutes; season with salt. Add vinegar and toss to coat. Cook just until vinegar and butter form a glaze over sprouts. Let cool; discard herbs.
Combine vinegar, mustard, lemon juice, and a big pinch of salt in a medium bowl. Finely grate in garlic and whisk to combine. Let sit 15 minutes.
Meanwhile, heat red pepper flakes, oregano, and 1/4 cup oil in a small saucepan over medium until oil is warm but not yet sizzling. Add remaining 2/3 cup oil to cool down infused oil.
Pour infused oil into vinegar mixture; whisk until smooth. Season vinaigrette with salt.
Toss chickpeas in a medium bowl with ¼ cup vinaigrette; season with salt. Let sit, tossing occasionally, until chickpeas taste like they’ve absorbed some vinaigrette, at least 10 minutes.
Toss scallions, salami, caciocavallo, olives, and dill into chickpeas. Scoop out bite-size pieces of roasted squash until you have 2 cups; save remaining squash for another use. Add to chickpea mixture along with brussels sprouts and glaze. Add radicchio and lettuce and toss to combine. Add more vinaigrette to taste; season with salt.
Serve salad topped with ricotta salata and pomegranate seeds.
